When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would do this when I want to share my work with others, as well as if I plan to work from multiple computers (laptop, desktop). It would also be useful to have a copy online to share with others and for a backup.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Personally, I wouldn't want to pull changes until i had my local code in a working state. then I could resolve conflicts from there. I wouldn't want to be dealing with conflict resolution in the middle of overhauling some code.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks are for when you want to work on someone else's GitHub project but you don't have permission to modify their repository, or just for when you want to clone a GitHub repository onto your own GitHub account. Cloning is for when you want to make a copy of a repository onto a computer, either from GitHub or from another computer or from another location on that computer. Branches are for when you want to keep track of different versions of code simultaneously.
